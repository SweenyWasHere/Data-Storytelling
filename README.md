Hi!  My name is Rich Sweeny.

Thank you for coming to my Data Storytelling repository.  As I'm sure you know, with the growth of analytics, there has been an explosion of interest in combining the mountains of available data with fluid, flexible, real-time graphics to create simple, coherent ideas.  Data Storytelling allows executives, managers and even salespeople to focus their complex data into easily understood messaging that allows their audience quickly grasp the point.
The purpose of this repository is to allow hiring managers to see my basic coding skills - so you can spend more time interviewing coders and less time with posers.  (Here's hoping you consider me in the first group!)

The coding examples I will be publishing here utilize three core Microsoft applications that factor heavily into department-based analytics projects.  They are Excel, Access, and Power BI.  These are also the areas where I do most of my coding.  
I have also posted a couple of projects I created in PowerPoint, (as PDF files).  I included them because I have been using data storytelling techniques for nearly 20 years - before it was called data storytelling.  

An excellent example is the “Monthly Data Review.pdf”, a template I created in my wireless management & optimization business, XRay Wireless Managed Services.  That presentation includes slides that use a four-quadrant format of Chart, Table, Status, and Issues.  It has one slide each for eleven cost areas using that format.  It also has several multi-table slides and an executive summary section.

EXCEL:  You will see lots of automation using VBA code to create powerful controls to add and delete elements, move between worksheets, chart sheets and objects, manipulate multiple objects like workbook windows, formatting, etc.  There are also examples of complex formulas running across multiple worksheets and the use of Power Pivot and pivot tables and pivot charts.

ACCESS: I will be loading multiple Access databases.  
The first, the "NYC_DOB.accdb" file lists every permit the New York City Department of Buildings has issues for the past 15 years.  It includes over 1.6 million permits, (fields/rows) with 96 columns per field.

The second is an Access database called “Perception”, that I created for my wireless management and optimization business, XRay Wireless Managed Services.  I used this database to manage AT&T, Verizon and Sprint billing and equipment for multiple companies over a ten-year period.  My largest customer had nearly 800 cell phones with millions of fields of data."

POWER BI: The Power BI demos I will be loading use the data from my Excel and Access applications to re-create the charts and provide Data Storytelling on the powerful Power BI public platform.  They will also be available on "app.powerbi.com".
