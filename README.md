Hi!  My name is Rich Sweeny.

Thank you for coming to my Data Storytelling repository.  With the growth of analytics, there has been an explosion of interest in combining the mountains of available data with fluid, flexible, real-time graphics to create simple, coherent ideas.  Data Storytelling allows executives, managers and even salespeople to focus their complex data into easily understood messaging that allows their audience to quickly grasp their point.
The purpose of this repository is to allow hiring managers to see my Coding skills - so you can get an immediate sense of my ability to solve your programming problems. 

The coding examples I am publishing here use the three core Microsoft applications that factor heavily into department-based analytics projects.  They are Excel, MS Access and Power BI, along with VBA, SQL, DAX and overall Data Storytelling.  These are the areas where I do most of my coding.  

I have also posted a couple of projects I created in PowerPoint, (posted here as PDF files).  I included them because I have been using data storytelling techniques for nearly 20 years, before the term data storytelling was used.  But the skillset is the same.
The purpose of presenting these PowerPoint files is to demonstrate what Harvard Business School Online calls: 
“Soft skill counterparts.  It’s not enough to just analyze data; you need to know how to communicate the story it tells in a clear, compelling manner—a skill called Data Storytelling.”
see https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-storytelling"

My soft skills in combining the data into easily understood chunks can be seen in the two pdf files attached.  An excellent example is the “Monthly Data Review.pdf”, a template I created and used in my wireless management & optimization business, XRay Wireless Managed Services.  That presentation includes slides that use a four-quadrant format of Chart, Table, Status, and Issues.  It was a very effective design that I used for each of eleven separate cost areas to review expenses, provide status and explain issues and strategies moving forward – all in one slide!

There are 5 files currently in this repository, 2 Excel workbooks "SourceMobile Charts.xlsm" and "Input_Output_Demo_xlsm.zip", (which is a package of 11 files), two pdf files, "Monthly Data Review.pdf" and "XRay Wireless Brochures.pdf" and "RSweeny Developer Resume.docx".  I will be adding MS Access databases and PBIX files to demonstrate my Access and Power BI abilities next.

Here's a quick review of four files currently published on this page, plus my resume and some more that are coming soon:

1- Excel Workbook: SourceMobile_Charts.xlsm – Loaded in this repository now.
-
What it is:  
-
This is a workbook with a main sheet that functions like a homepage, has several dataset sheets and 16 chart sheets.  Its main focus is demonstrating Excel VBA automation.  The home page has over 30 VBA-enabled action buttons used to manipulate and change objects throughout the workbook.  BTW, the charts are from an older presentation.  I didn't bother to update the colors or labels because my role is to build the VBA automation, not design the look of the charts themselves.

What it does:  
-
After the file opens, the user is presented with the “SourceMobile Charting Suite” worksheet.

There is a welcome form that gives a brief explanation and then you’re free to tour the workbook. From that main worksheet, buttons take you to different chart sheets, allow you to zoom in and out of worksheets, change workbook window sizes, add or remove the ribbon and tool bars, delete chart data, headings & buttons and then add them all back in again!  I suggest you start with the “Chart Tour” button."  It works perfectly in Windows and also works well on the Mac.  But there are currently two known issues on Macs,  a) the “Resize Window” button throws an error.  It’s managed and won’t crash the program, but Resize does not work.  b) The “Delete Buttons” button will delete the buttons from the chart sheets, but the Add Buttons won’t add them back!  If you use that button, just close the app without saving it and reopen.  I will fix it soon.  It’s a Mac thing.  Argghh!

2- Data Storytelling: XRay Wireless Monthly Data Review.pdf - Loaded in this repository now.
-
What it is:  
-
This is a standard template that I used in my business to present monthly reporting to my customers that includes two slides of explanation, three slides with tables and twelve slides that show a combination of chart, table, status and overview.  These slides provide 12-month trending on a specific expense topic.  The topics include average corporate discounts, total monthly charges, average cost/minute, average cost/phone, messaging, data, roaming usage & charges, etc.

What it does:  
-
This was a PowerPoint presentation.  What it shows you is how I have been using data storytelling techniques for over fifteen years.  The combined slides that include graphs, tables, status and overview are a particularly good example of a Power BI-like story that I was using long before Power BI became a thing.  In fact, that's one reason I like Power BI so much!

3-Data Storytelling: XRay Wireless Brochure Pack.xlsm - Loaded in this repository now.
-
What it is:  
-
These are brochures that I created for my business, XRay Wireless Managed Services.  They include graphics, charts and text I used to communicate my company's value statement to customers.

What it does:  
-
I am demonstrating my “hard skills” with specific examples of my work in Excel, Access and Power BI.  
These brochures were designed and created entirely by me.  The purpose of presenting the brochures here is to demonstrate my "soft skill counterparts" for Data Storytelling.

4- Excel Workbook: Input_Output_Demo_xlsm.zip - Loaded in this repository now.
-
What it is:  
-
This is a workbook that starts with a single worksheet, lots of VBA and multiple input files.  The input files include another Excel workbook, an Access database and four separate CSV files.  All three sources contain the same datasets to import.  It also includes BMP and PNG files to import.  

The Excel workbook, "Input_Output_Demo.xlsm" is packaged in a zip file along with 10 other files, an Access database, another Excel workbook, four CSV files and multiple picture files.  The embedded VBA code imports the included files into the Excel workbook during the build process, adding them to worksheets and forms.

What it does:  
-
This file demonstrates my ability to use VBA to automate an Excel workbook by importing data and pictures from excel, access and CSV files.  It also shows my ability to use data to create very complex formulas in a workbook, all created from VBA.

After the file opens, the user clicks on one single colored cell in the one existing worksheet and the VBA builds an “Import form”.  The Import form asks you to choose the format of the import data, either CSV, Excel or Access.  After choosing the type of file(s) to import, the VBA imports the data and creates a dozen worksheets with either complex Excel formulas, charts or information about the user's Windows environment, PC chipset, etc."


THESE FILES WILL BE COMING SOON:


5- Power BI: Data Storytelling using data from SourceMobile_Charts.xlsm - Coming soon.
-
What it is:  
-
This is a Power BI file that I am building by taking the datasets from SourceMobile_Charts.xlsm, using Power Query to transform them and then rebuilding the 16 SourceMobile charts in Power BI.  It will also have new twists on the old data.

What it does:  
-
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how data from Excel and potentially some of my Access databases can be presented in Power BI.  Power BI not only has the ETL capabilities that come from Power Query, but also the portability and worldwide reach of the app.powerbi.com website.  

6- Access DB: NYC_DOB_Permits.accdb - Coming soon.
-
What it is:  
-
This is a database I created that contains every permit approved by the New York City Department of buildings over the previous 15-year period.  It currently contains over 1.6 million fields with 96 columns of data in each field.

What it does:  
-
My NYC DOB database allows a user to view the raw tables or pull up individual reports for every single permit issued anywhere in New York City over the previous 15 years.
Users can pull up detailed information on permits based on: Main Permit by Job number, All Permits by Job number, Block/Lot ID, Permits by business name, Permits by Job address, Permits by Owner and Permits by General Contractor.   My database is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to use than the NYC DOB website!

7- Access DB: PERCEPTION.accdb - Coming soon.
-
What it is:  
-
This is the Access database I created in 2005 and used in my business, XRay Wireless Managed Services for eight years.  

What it does:  
-
PERCEPTION is a database that imports wireless billing data from every major cellular carrier via an ETL process and then provides comprehensive and highly detailed reporting for corporate end-users.  It is used to run monthly optimization on every cell phone for a dozen different types of expenses.  It tracks every call, message and data byte used.  It provides dozens of reports broken down by company, time-period, division, department, or individual user.  PERCEPTION captures trending data for Monthly Data Reviews as well as department management.  It also offers equipment tracking, ordering and inventory management through serial numbers, IMEI phone type, models, etc.
